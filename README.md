I write a book about old computers. Oh, sorry: I mean "vintage computers" from the 80's. My primary goal is to show how one can build an 8bit computer from scratch.

It means: how to set up a CPU, how to connect memories, how to connect peripheral chips, and why to connect...

This computer is a "demo construction": A computer, based on 8085 CPU, with 32 kB of (EEP)ROM and 32 kB of RAM, serial connection and parallel ports. All should be as simple as possible. And here is a result.
